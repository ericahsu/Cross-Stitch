Cross Stitch
The user will be able to upload an image by pasting in the pathname or a url. The image will then be converted into a cross stitch pattern that is made up of pixels, with a list of the color of threads needed. The cross stitch pattern can be of the full photo or the central feature. The patterns uploaded will be saved to a history which can be accessed later. The patterns in the history will be tagged by the style and favorites.

How to run:
Run webscrape.py and history.py first. Then run __init__.py.
It can take up to ~1 minute for the pattern to load depending on the size of the image.


Libraries that need to be installed:
Beautiful Soup, pandas, requests
